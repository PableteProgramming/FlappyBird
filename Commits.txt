Explanations for Pablito :

- I added the background and ground after scaling them, nothing much yet.

- To make the ground move, I simply created a vector which contains three separate sprites. I then check the 
following : if the sprite in the middle has an x coord of 0, than push back a new sprite and delete the first one ; 
else just subtract from the x coord to make the ground move.
