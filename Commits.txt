Explanations for Pablito :

- I added the background and ground after scaling them, nothing much yet.

- To make the ground move, I simply created a vector which contains three separate sprites. I then check the 
following : if the sprite in the middle has an x coord of 0, than push back a new sprite and delete the first one ; 
else just subtract from the x coord to make the ground move.

- To make the tubes move, I used the same concept as for the ground. The only difference is that I stored the tubes
in a vector in pairs (the one up and down) and displayed them at the same time. I had to resize the tubes with pixel
art because they weren't long enough and using the setScale() or scale() function in SFML would make them look ugly.
